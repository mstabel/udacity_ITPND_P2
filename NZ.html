            It is really hard to choose the best sight in New Zealand. We only visited the south island, but were constantly amazed by New Zealands nature. We rented a campervan and drove through the island by ourselves, starting in christchurch, passing the arthur`s pass and driving down the west side of the island, followed by the way back to christchurch on the east coast. Despite our first time being so close to glaciers (Franz Josef and Fox glacier) and the amazing atmosphere in the very cool towns of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wanaka">Wanaka</a> and Queenstown, our highlight on the west side of the island was the visit to Milford Sound. Our camping site was in Te Anau, a small and quiet town with a recommendable small cinema with an amazing atmosphere (and best mulled wine we ever had!). From Te Anau we made our way to Milford Sound and had amazing scenic views as we were driving through the Fiordland National Park. There are such beautiful places there! When we made it to Milford Sound we left the campervan behind and bought tickets for a cruise through Milford Sound. We were really lucky with the weather as we were told that the chances for rain are (constantly) very high. We had no drop of rain though and had hence really good views on the cruise and were able to stay on deck. Pictures can`t really capture how beautiful and astonishing this place it! Waterfalls, cliffs, ink-like water and alpine peaks surrounding us. Although we were there in winter, we saw penguins and sea lions. If you ever have the chance to come to new zealand, it is definitley compulsory to go there!:)
            On our way back to christchurch we passed a few lakes and towns, but also our second highlight of new zealands south island: Aroaki Mount Cook! We hiked the Hooker Valley Track to see it (i`m not sure you can really call it a hike, as it is pretty flat and doesn`t require much fitness :D)  and we would definitley recommend going there as well. The track is beautiful, you can see many wild flowers, a small river, moraine ridges and humps and the surrounding mountains. The track ends with an astonishing view over the Hooker Lake (speckled with icebergs!) and the majestic Aoraki Mount Cook. We have never seen such a place before and were therefore very impressed.
            We havn`t had the chance to see all MUST SEE sights in New Zealands South Island. But Milford Sound and Aoraki Mount Cook are for sure worth a trip!

              We rented our campervan at Travellers Autobarn (recommendation by our travel agency) and were very content! We named it „Baby“ :D Also we didn`t have much experience with driving such a big vehicle or camping in such a way on camp sites. But it was definitely very fun and a great experience. We had no problems what so ever with Baby, it was clean and comfortable. We had a small kitchenette and a „chill area“ that could be changed into our bed at night. As we were visiting New Zealand in winter it got pretty cold at night. Thank god we listened to our contact at Travellers Autobarn and rented an electric heater (even though it costs a bit extra, we would always do it again, otherwise it is just too cold to sleep at the campervan).

            First thing we noticed was how nice and polite people are in New Zealand! So amazing. People in Germany are so grumpy and unpolite in comparison to New Zealanders! Everywhere we went, people were always willing to help us out or had a nice chat with us. Even though there a big debates about handling the stream of tourists coming to New Zealand (especially in summer) and the environmental issues, we felt nothing of that what so ever. We felt that people are nice, open-minded and happy to show around or talk about their country.
